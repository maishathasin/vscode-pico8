![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/maishathasin/vscode-pico8)


Welcome to the PICO-8 Theme for Visual Studio Code! This theme is inspired by the aesthetics of the PICO-8 fantasy console's text editor, aiming to bring the nostalgic and retro feel into your modern coding environment.

## Typography and cursor 

I am using the pico-8 font from https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2052852/pico-8-27 , and I  have my own personal settings for the cursor. To change the font and the cursor settings:

1. Download the font and install the font to your computer
    - (MAC USERS): after unzipping the file -> click the **.tff** file and click **Download**

2. Open Vscode and then go to the command palette **(Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)** and type `"Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"`, Edit your user settings to include

```
{
    "[python]": {
        "editor.formatOnType": true
    },
    "solidity.telemetry": false,
    "window.zoomLevel": 1,
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "editorCursor.foreground": "#FF004D" ,// Pink color for the cursor,
